# Rewrk

Rewrk is a digital service provider where customers can come and view each of the services offered by Rewrk, developed for Milestone 4 as part of the Code Institute/UCD - Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications)

There are two types of users, and I have set up accounts for both

An admin(administrator) user account has been set up with username/password of admin/Password1@
A regular(shopper) user account has been set up with username/password of Test13/Password1@

# Overview

* This project is a website is for submission as milestone project 4 as part of the Code Institute - Diploma in Software * Development (Full stack) course.
* The website is deployed using Heroku pages at the following url: https://rewrk-ms4.herokuapp.com/
* The repository on GitHub that contains the website source code and assets is available at the following url:https://github.com/Aoibhinn/Rewrk_MS4
* The website was built with a responsive look and feel for desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

# UX
## Strategy 

The primary goal of the website from a site users perspective is as follows:

* To register for an account on the website and receive a notification successful registration.
* To login or logout from the website.
* Have a personalised booking page to view, edit and delete booked services

* To book a serice without requiring an account
* To view case a list of case studies on the website 
* View individual case study details (comment, like, case study content)

## Skeleton
### Wireframes
I used Balsamiq to create the wireframes.
Wireframes were not created for the Service, ServiceDetail, Login  pages as the basic design is similar to other form styled pages.



## Surface
### Color Palette
The main colors used in this project:
* Font and Accent color: #4C6FBF blue
* Background color: Black #003060; navy

### Typography
Sans-Serif is used as the main font. I did not feel it necessary to change the default font type as Sans-Serif is an easy font to read and displays well throughout the site.

### Images
Images were sourced from canva.com

# Testing
## Functionality Testing
### Manual testing
* I used Google Chrome developer tools throughout the development process for testing and solving problems with style and display issues.
* I used Github Project and Issues to track tasks. After each task completion, I would fully test it before moving on to the next task.
* All links were tested multiple times during the development process and again once the project was completed to ensure that all pages were linked correctly.
* All Forms and form elements were tested to ensure that they work as they should, with user feedback on errors as well as user feedback on successful submission.


## Code Validation
**1. CSS Validation using <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input" target="_blank" rel="noopener">W3C CSS Validator Services</a>.**

No errors were found in the style.css
<img src="media/images/Screenshot 2021-11-28 at 11.38.40.png">


**2. <a href="http://pep8online.com/">PEP8</a> was used to test the Python code**

All Python files were tested with PEP8, with no errors found.
There were some pylint errors in gitpod regarding missing docstrings, these errors were fixed during development.


## Compatibility Testing
* The website was tested on Google Chrome, and apple cellphones.
* The website was viewed on a variety of device sizes such as Desktop, Iphone11, I also used the responsive function when inspecting the pages to view various sizes.

# Deployment
The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps, I used Gitpod as a development environment where I commited all changes to git version control system. I used the push command in Gitpod to save changes into GitHub.

### Deployment to Heroku
Before creating a Heroku app make sure your project has these two files:

* requirements.txt - You can create one by using <code>pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt</code>
* Procfile - You can create one by using echo web: <code>python run.py > Procfile</code>

### Create application:

1. Navigate to Heroku's site <a href="https://id.heroku.com/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. (Note: Right click on link to open a new tab).
2. Register and/or Login as applicable.
3. Click on the new button in the top right and select "Create new app".
4. Enter the app name and region closest to you.
5. Click the create app button.

### Set environment variables:

1. Click on the settings tab and then click "Reveal config vars".
2. Config variables added throughout project:
(add image of variables)

### Setting up database in deployment

1. Temporarily add the <code>DATABASE_URL</code> to <code>settings.py</code>:

    <code>DATABASES = {
'default': dj_database_url.parse('your_postgres_database_url')
}</code>

2. Migrate the data from development to production version.

    * To migrate the database models in the project to the Postgres database you can use the following command:

    <code>python3 manage.py migrate</code>

3. You will then need a superuser for the Postgres database too. To create one you can use the following command:

    <code>python3 manage.py createsuperuser</code>

4. Remove the Postgres database URL from settings.py as this should not in any case be deployed to GitHub for security reasons.

5. To connect your Heroku app to be deployed from a Github repository, you can follow these steps:

    * Open the heroku app page on the deploy tab and select GitHub - Connect to GitHub.
    * Sign into GitHub if not already.
    * A prompt to find a Github repository to connect to will then be displayed.
    * Enter the repository name for the project and click search.
    * Once the repository has been found, click the connect button.

6. Once you have your GitHub repository connected, without leaving deploy tab:

    * Under Automatic deploys section, choose the branch you want to deploy from and then click the "Enable Automatic Deploys" button.
    * To deploy your app to Heroku click the "Deploy Branch" button.

# Rewrk

## Project 4 - Full Stack Toolkit
<img src="media/images/home.png">

# Overview

Rewrk is a digital service provider where customers can come and view each of the services offered by Rewrk. Customers are able to read case studies about businesses who have utilised Rewrkâ€™s services to ensure they are a credible provider. 

Site administrators have the ability to add, remove or update services and case studies to ensure the most up to date content is being presented to customers. Customers are able to create an account with Rewrk to view booked services and become part of a Rewrk community. 

This combined with an intuitive interface aims to deliver a smooth and enjoyable customer experience to maximise repeat visits to the site

The live site can be found <a href="https://rewrk-ms4.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. (Note: Right click on link to open a new tab).



# Strategy 

During the pandemic a lot of local businesses were forced to close their doors for months. Prior to this many businesses did not have e-commerce websites or even social media accounts and when they were forced to close they were unable to reach any of their customers. 

Rewkrs aim is to provide these businesses with access to digital services at reasonable prices. Many web development companies charge high prices that can be out of reach to local, small businesses. Rewkrs aim is not only to create a digital presence for the business but also to educate business owners on how to continue to grow their business online long after working with Rewrk by creating a community that receives monthly emails from Rewrk.

## Wireframes
I used Balsamiq to create the wireframes.
Wireframes were not created for the Service, ServiceDetail, Login  pages as the basic design is similar to other form styled pages.

* Home page

* service detail

* service booking

## Design
### Colors
The main colors used in this project:
* Font and Accent color: #4C6FBF blue
* Background color: Black #003060; navy

### Fonts
Sans-Serif is used as the main font. I did not feel it necessary to change the default font type as Sans-Serif is an easy font to read and displays well throughout the site.

# Testing
## Functionality Testing
### Manual testing
* I used Google Chrome developer tools throughout the development process for testing and solving problems with style and display issues.
* I used Github Project and Issues to track tasks. After each task completion, I would fully test it before moving on to the next task.
* All links were tested multiple times during the development process and again once the project was completed to ensure that all pages were linked correctly.
* All Forms and form elements were tested to ensure that they work as they should, with user feedback on errors as well as user feedback on successful submission.

## Code Validation

### CSS Validation using W3C CSS Validator Services.
No errors were found in the style.css

## Code Validation
**1. CSS Validation using <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input" target="_blank" rel="noopener">W3C CSS Validator Services</a>.**

No errors were found in the style.css
<img src="media/images/Screenshot 2021-11-28 at 11.38.40.png">


**2. <a href="http://pep8online.com/">PEP8</a> was used to test the Python code**

All Python files were tested with PEP8, with no errors found.
There were some pylint errors in gitpod regarding missing docstrings, these errors were fixed during development.


## Compatibility Testing
* The website was tested on Google Chrome, and apple cellphones.
* The website was viewed on a variety of device sizes such as Desktop, Iphone11, I also used the responsive function when inspecting the pages to view various sizes.

# Deployment
The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps, I used Gitpod as a development environment where I commited all changes to git version control system. I used the push command in Gitpod to save changes into GitHub.

### Deployment to Heroku
Before creating a Heroku app make sure your project has these two files:

* requirements.txt - You can create one by using <code>pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt</code>
* Procfile - You can create one by using echo web: <code>python run.py > Procfile</code>

### Create application:

1. Navigate to Heroku's site <a href="https://id.heroku.com/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. (Note: Right click on link to open a new tab).
2. Register and/or Login as applicable.
3. Click on the new button in the top right and select "Create new app".
4. Enter the app name and region closest to you.
5. Click the create app button.

### Set environment variables:

1. Click on the settings tab and then click "Reveal config vars".

2. Config variables added throughout project:
(add image of variables)

### Setting up database in deployment

1. Temporarily add the <code>DATABASE_URL</code> to <code>settings.py</code>:

    <code>DATABASES = {
'default': dj_database_url.parse('your_postgres_database_url')
}</code>

2. Migrate the data from development to production version.

    * To migrate the database models in the project to the Postgres database you can use the following command:

    <code>python3 manage.py migrate</code>

3. You will then need a superuser for the Postgres database too. To create one you can use the following command:

    <code>python3 manage.py createsuperuser</code>

4. Remove the Postgres database URL from settings.py as this should not in any case be deployed to GitHub for security reasons.

5. To connect your Heroku app to be deployed from a Github repository, you can follow these steps:

    * Open the heroku app page on the deploy tab and select GitHub - Connect to GitHub.
    * Sign into GitHub if not already.
    * A prompt to find a Github repository to connect to will then be displayed.
    * Enter the repository name for the project and click search.
    * Once the repository has been found, click the connect button.

6. Once you have your GitHub repository connected, without leaving deploy tab:

    * Under Automatic deploys section, choose the branch you want to deploy from and then click the "Enable Automatic Deploys" button.
    * To deploy your app to Heroku click the "Deploy Branch" button.

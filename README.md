# Rewrk

Rewrk is a digital service provider where customers can come and view each of the services offered by Rewrk, developed for Milestone 4 as part of the Code Institute/UCD - Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications)

There are two types of users, and I have set up accounts for both

An admin(administrator) user account has been set up with username/password of admin/Password1@
A regular(shopper) user account has been set up with username/password of Test13/Password1@

# Project Overview

* This project is a website is for submission as milestone project 4 as part of the Code Institute - Diploma in Software * Development (Full stack) course.
* The website is deployed using Heroku pages at the following url: https://rewrk-ms4.herokuapp.com/
* The repository on GitHub that contains the website source code and assets is available at the following url:https://github.com/Aoibhinn/Rewrk_MS4
* The website was built with a responsive look and feel for desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

# UX
## Strategy 

The primary goal of the website from a site users perspective is as follows:

* To book a serice without requiring an account
* To view case a list of case studies on the website 
* View individual case study details (comment, like, case study content)


## Structure

* I used the Bootstrap grid system throughout, which gave a consistent structure and responsive design "out of the box".
* Below are the main page's/features functionality wise, there are some others for password reset/verification etc. that are described in the user story section.
* All pages have a common look and feel and a common header/footer. On a tablet/mobile the look and feel is slightly different with a burger menu.

## Skeleton
### Wireframes
I used Balsamiq to create the wireframes.
Wireframes were not created for the Service, ServiceDetail, Login  pages as the basic design is similar to other form styled pages.

## Surface
### Color Palette
I have gone for a simple and minimal design for the website, with predominately Navy, Blue and white font colours
There are five colours in the color palette
* Font and Accent color: #4C6FBF blue
* Background color: Black #003060; navy
* #ffff - White for background colours

### Typography
Sans-Serif is used as the main font. I did not feel it necessary to change the default font type as Sans-Serif is an easy font to read and displays well throughout the site.

The Sans-Serif font is the main font used throughout the whole website. This font is from the Google fonts library.

# Testing
The testing information and results for this project are documented in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)

# Deployment
The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps, I used Gitpod as a development environment where I commited all changes to git version control system. I used the push command in Gitpod to save changes into GitHub.

## Cloning using Github
[Repository Link](https://github.com/Aoibhinn/Rewrk_MS4)

* Log in to Github.
* Access my repository using the above link.
* In the repository page select code next to Gitpod.
* Button, make sure HTTPS is selected.
* Click on the copy button on the right (Two overlapping squares)
* Open a new workspace in Gitpod.
* Once the workspace loads in the terminal type. git clone https://github.com/aoibhinn/rewrk_ms4

## Forking using Github
* You can contribute to this project without affecting the main branch with the following steps.
* Navigate to github repositores select this repository.
* On the right of the repository name you will find the fork button next to the star and watch buttons.
* Pressing said button will create a copy for you to use.

### Deployment to Heroku
Before creating a Heroku app make sure your project has these two files:

* requirements.txt - You can create one by using <code>pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt</code>
* Procfile - You can create one by using echo web: <code>python run.py > Procfile</code>

### Create application:

1. Navigate to Heroku's site <a href="https://id.heroku.com/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. (Note: Right click on link to open a new tab).
2. Register and/or Login as applicable.
3. Click on the new button in the top right and select "Create new app".
4. Enter the app name and region closest to you.
5. Click the create app button.

### Set environment variables:

1. Click on the settings tab and then click "Reveal config vars".
2. Config variables added throughout project:
[Config Vars](readme/testing/heroku_config_vards.png)

### Setting up database in deployment

1. Temporarily add the <code>DATABASE_URL</code> to <code>settings.py</code>:

    <code>DATABASES = {
'default': dj_database_url.parse('your_postgres_database_url')
}</code>

2. Migrate the data from development to production version.

    * To migrate the database models in the project to the Postgres database you can use the following command:

    <code>python3 manage.py migrate</code>

3. You will then need a superuser for the Postgres database too. To create one you can use the following command:

    <code>python3 manage.py createsuperuser</code>

4. Remove the Postgres database URL from settings.py as this should not in any case be deployed to GitHub for security reasons.

5. To connect your Heroku app to be deployed from a Github repository, you can follow these steps:

    * Open the heroku app page on the deploy tab and select GitHub - Connect to GitHub.
    * Sign into GitHub if not already.
    * A prompt to find a Github repository to connect to will then be displayed.
    * Enter the repository name for the project and click search.
    * Once the repository has been found, click the connect button.

6. Once you have your GitHub repository connected, without leaving deploy tab:

    * Under Automatic deploys section, choose the branch you want to deploy from and then click the "Enable Automatic Deploys" button.
    * To deploy your app to Heroku click the "Deploy Branch" button.

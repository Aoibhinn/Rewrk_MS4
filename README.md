# Overview

Rewrk is a digital service provider where customers can come and view each of the services offered by Rewrk. Customers are able to read case studies about businesses who have utilised Rewrkâ€™s services to ensure they are a credible provider. 

Site administrators have the ability to add, remove or update services and case studies to ensure the most up to date content is being presented to customers. Customers are able to create an account with Rewrk to view booked services and become part of a Rewrk community. 

This combined with an intuitive interface aims to deliver a smooth and enjoyable customer experience to maximise repeat visits to the site

The live site can be found <a href="https://rewrk-ms4.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. (Note: Right click on link to open a new tab).

# Strategy 

During the pandemic a lot of local businesses were forced to close their doors for months. Prior to this many businesses did not have e-commerce websites or even social media accounts and when they were forced to close they were unable to reach any of their customers. 

Rewkrs aim is to provide these businesses with access to digital services at reasonable prices. Many web development companies charge high prices that can be out of reach to local, small businesses. Rewkrs aim is not only to create a digital presence for the business but also to educate business owners on how to continue to grow their business online long after working with Rewrk by creating a community that receives monthly emails from Rewrk.

## Wireframes
I used Balsamiq to create the wireframes.
Wireframes were not created for the Service, ServiceDetail, Login  pages as the basic design is similar to other form styled pages.

## Design
### Colors
The main colors used in this project:
* Background color: #4C6FBF blue
* Font color: Black #003060; navy

### Fonts
Sans-Serif is used as the main font. I did not feel it necessary to change the default font type as Sans-Serif is an easy font to read and displays well throughout the site.
